          <p>I am an experienced people oriented Front End Developer, with a strong focus on User Experience and UI Development. I have 4+ years  commercial front-end development experience in various industries, ranging from fast-paced digital agencies, fin-techs, start-ups, professional governing institutions and various business projects. I specialise in the standard Front-end stack and I constantly up-skill myself on new frameworks and processes through personal pet projects, freelance projects and commerrcial work experience.</p>
          <p>
            I strive to create amazing digital experiences for consumers and I am passionate about building early-stage companies. I believe that having a functional website is only a part of the solution. Principles such as Progressive Enhancement, SEO optimised websites with Semantic HTML and Accessibility principles are key concepts on being noticed in the Internet 'jungle'.
        </p>
          <p>
            Also, as a Front End developer, it's important to think from a consumers point of view as they are the primary audience and the code you produce is their first point of interation so it needs to leave a good impression :)
